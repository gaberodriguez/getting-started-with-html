<h1>Key Points</h1>

<b>The Web</b>

<p>The
 web consists of a bunch of computers communicating
  and connected together. When ever someone opens up browser
  like chrome, firefox, and internet explorer and go to a certain 
  website like facebook.com they request this page through
  the HTTP protocol from a server so the browser can no display 
  that page.
</p>
<b>HTML</b>
<p>
HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. There are many different 
content types that can be viewed through a browser but the 
majority is going to be HTML. HTML documents contain two types of information
which is text and visual (how it looks). 
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>
HTML documents conisit of HTML <b>elements</b>. When we write
HTML we tell the browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
<br>
<br>

An element is a group of tags. For example some elements are comprised of
an opening tag, contents, and a closing tag. like <em>b</em> and <em>/b</em> are tags to make the contents 
between them bold.
There are many different tags.

<br><b>"em"</b>- Italics
<br><b>"a"</b>- Anchor
<br><b>"p"</b>- Paragraph

<br><br>
Anchor's are different in that it contains an "Attributes".
Tags can have multiple attributes. The Anchor tag in example can have
<b>href</b> as the attribute name which is used to make links. Like this <a href="www.google.com">one</a>.
This link will take you google when you click on the word "one".
<p><b>Images</b></p>
Images are a tag as well they pull an image from a server where the picture
is stored and display them on the browser. When you create an Image tag you
need to write the address to the picture after "<b>src</b>" which stands
for source, we also need an alternate text to display when the image can not be pulled.
Which comes after "<b>alt</b>". Because the image has no content it does not need a closing tag.

<p><b>Inline</b> vs <b>Block</b></p>

Inline would be text in line and we can use the "br" tag is like hitting
enter in Word. And Block is things like the "p" which would create a Paragraph and what this
does is it creates a block of space around the text within the "p"
tags.

<p><b>span / div</b></p>
These tags are both noraml tags they both contain text. The only difference it that
"span" is inline and "div" is block. These are both used to adding styles to your documents.

<p><b>Computers are stupid</b></p>

Computers are stupid because we have to tell them exatcly the right format. They take everything
literally. Which makes things complicated when someone makes a single error in code. Because the computer
will not tell you what's wrong or where the error is.
